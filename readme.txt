#### 18 Built-in Elements for Placement Inside the Builder
The builder already includes all the necessary elements for creating various forms. Place elements inside the form for information collection, complex forms with multiple calculations, and even a shopping cart with the ability to add several products and subsequent payment. Here is the full list of elements for use:

[Multiple Choice](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_1) — allows the user to select multiple items in it. Settings allow specifying the minimum and maximum number of items to choose from. Perfect for choosing additional services, options, products, etc.

[Single Choice](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_2) — most often used for choosing the main service or only one option from several presented.

[Image Choice](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_3) — allows the user to choose an answer option with an attached image. By default, you can only choose one answer option, but if necessary

[Dropdown](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_4) — intended for selecting one item from many. Unlike single choice, it allows hiding many elements, making it more compact.

[Range](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_5) — allows the user to select a number with a slider from a given range. Its settings allow choosing a numerical segment and assigning a step.

[Shopping Cart](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_6) — this widget is unique and allows creating mini-shops using various configurations inside the form with subsequent sending of notifications by email, Telegram, or to a CRM system and even receiving payment.

[Formula](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_7) — designed for creating calculations based on selected parameters in the form. Supports logical expressions, as well as more than 20 mathematical functions!

[Text Input](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_8) — a standard field for entering text. Can be used for entering a small amount of text. Also allows setting an input mask to facilitate user entry.

[Numeric Input](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_9) — a field for entering a number, which can later participate in the calculations of your formulas.

[Email](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_10) — a field intended for entering an email address. Validation settings are already technically set, and entering an incorrect email address is not possible.

[Mobile Phone](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_11) — like the email input field, it has technically set validation settings. Supports validation for more than 10 countries.

[Date and Time](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_12) — fields for choosing a date in the form of a calendar and time. If necessary, time can be disabled.

[File Upload](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_13) — allows users to upload files of different formats. The element includes fine-tuning of the formats of uploaded files. You can prohibit or allow the upload of certain file formats.

[Rating](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_14) — used for collecting feedback by choosing the number of stars.

[Button](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_15) — allows placing a button with an assigned action. Includes printing the form, sending the form, going to the payment page, or opening a link when pressed.

[Image](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_16) — in this element, you can place your image in jpg, jpeg, png, gif, and svg formats.

[Message](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_17) — is ordinary text with the possibility of styling (boldness, size, color, etc.).

[Code](https://stepform.io/docs/elements#anchor_18) — provides the possibility of placing your own code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


#### Design a layout that suits your website or brand
Use ready-made color schemes or create your own with a variety of design settings. You can change the design of every element placed in the form. Not enough built-in design settings 🤔? You can always add your own CSS styles directly in the builder.

#### Accept payments within the form
Set up integration with one of six possible payment systems and receive payments after the forms are filled out. Want to save responses only after successful payment? With Stripe or PayPal, you can save information after filling it out only in case of successful payment by the user.

#### Receive responses in an internal CRM
All responses go into a convenient internal CRM system. It allows you to export received responses, as well as create custom statuses and mark them as they are processed. Don't want to use our CRM? Connect integration with Bitrix24 and receive them automatically after your forms are filled out.

#### Get notifications about form submissions
You can connect a notification to the form via email, through webhooks, SMS messages to your phone numbers, notifications in Telegram personal messages or group, as well as the ability to save them inside Firebase. Choose the most convenient way for you to receive notifications and don't miss a single request!

#### Use a library of ready-made templates
It features over 100 different templates on various topics. Starting from simple feedback collection forms to complex calculators with multiple formulas. Whether to take a ready-made template or use it as a basis is up to you.

#### Forms are adapted for all types of devices
After creating a form, it automatically adapts to any device screens. You don't need to separately think about mobile or tablet versions of forms, the builder will do everything for you. You can immediately see how your created form will look on different devices right inside the builder.

#### Collect statistics on form visits
Forms can be integrated with analytics services. There are 5 services to choose from, which will help you conduct analytics on form visits and achievements of already planned goals/events within the builder. Starting from the opening of the form and ending with the filling of specific forms, and then sending the form itself.
